\## Installation

To run this game on your local machine, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps to set up the game:

\### Clone the Repository:

\```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git  
\```

\### Navigate to the Project Directory:

\```bash  
cd tic-tac-toe  
\```

\### Ensure Python is Installed:

Check if Python is installed by running:

\```bash  
python --version  
\```

If Python is not installed, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

\## Usage

To start the Tic-Tac-Toe game, simply run the `main.py` file:

\```bash  
python3 main.py  
\```

If you are using Windows, you might need to use `python` instead of `python3`:

\```bash  
python main.py  
\```

\## How to Play

\- The game will start with a welcome message.  
\- Player 1 will be assigned the symbol "X" and Player 2 will be assigned the symbol "O".  
\- Players take turns to enter their moves by specifying the grid position (e.g., a1, b2, c3).  
\- The board is displayed after each move, showing the updated state.  
\- The game will check for a win or a draw after each move:  
\- If a player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, they win.  
\- If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.  
\- After the game ends, players will be prompted to play again or exit.

\## Game Flow

1. **Start of the Game:** The game begins with a welcome message, and the board is displayed with empty cells.  
2. **Player Turn:** Players will be prompted to enter their move. The game will validate the move and update the board if it's valid.  
3. **Winning/Draw Condition:** The game will check for a win or draw after each move. If either condition is met, the game will end and display the result.  
4. **Replay Option:** After the game ends, players can choose to play again or exit the game.
